# Debugging Guide

Learn systematic approaches to debugging with AI assistance in Enfiy Code.

## Overview

Debugging with AI assistance can dramatically speed up problem resolution. This guide shows you how to effectively use Enfiy Code for debugging various types of issues.

## General Debugging Approach

### 1. Gather Information

```bash
# Start with error details
> Help me debug this error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined at line 45

# Provide context
> This error occurs when users try to load their profile page
> The error started happening after I updated the user authentication system
```

### 2. Analyze the Problem

```bash
# Get AI analysis
> What could cause this error in a React component?
> Analyze this function and identify potential issues
> Review this code path for logical errors
```

### 3. Generate Solutions

```bash
# Request specific fixes
> Add null checks to prevent this undefined error
> Implement proper error handling for this API call
> Create defensive programming patterns for this function
```

## Common Debugging Scenarios

### Runtime Errors

#### Undefined/Null Reference Errors

```bash
# Provide the error and context
> Error: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
> This happens when loading the user's posts in the dashboard component

# Ask for analysis
> Check this component for potential undefined array access
> Add proper loading states and null checks
```

#### Type Errors

```bash
# TypeScript compilation errors
> TS2339: Property 'username' does not exist on type 'User'
> Help me fix the type definitions for the User interface

# Runtime type mismatches
> This function expects a string but receives a number
> Add proper type validation and conversion
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Rendering

```bash
# React performance problems
> This component re-renders too frequently, causing performance issues
> Analyze this component for unnecessary re-renders
> Add React.memo and useMemo optimizations where appropriate
```

#### Memory Leaks

```bash
# Memory management issues
> This page's memory usage keeps increasing
> Check for memory leaks in event listeners and subscriptions
> Add proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
```

### API and Network Issues

#### Failed API Calls

```bash
# Network debugging
> API calls are failing with 500 errors
> Debug this fetch request that's not returning expected data
> Add proper error handling and retry logic for API calls
```

#### CORS Issues

```bash
# Cross-origin problems
> Getting CORS errors when calling the API from the frontend
> Configure CORS settings for the Express server
> Set up proper API endpoint configuration
```

### Database Issues

#### Query Problems

```bash
# SQL debugging
> This database query is returning unexpected results
> Optimize this slow-running query
> Debug the relationship mappings in this Prisma schema
```

#### Connection Issues

```bash
# Database connectivity
> Database connection is timing out
> Add proper connection pooling and error handling
> Configure database connection retry logic
```

## Debugging by Technology

### React Applications

#### Component Issues

```bash
# State management problems
> State updates are not triggering re-renders
> This useEffect is running infinitely
> Component state is getting out of sync with props

# Hook debugging
> This custom hook is not working as expected
> Debug the dependency array in this useEffect
> Fix the stale closure problem in this callback
```

#### Rendering Problems

```bash
# Display issues
> Component is not rendering the updated data
> CSS styles are not being applied correctly
> Conditional rendering is not working as expected
```

### Node.js Applications

#### Server Errors

```bash
# Express.js debugging
> Server is crashing with unhandled promise rejection
> Middleware is not executing in the correct order
> Route parameters are not being parsed correctly
```

#### Asynchronous Issues

```bash
# Promise and async/await problems
> Async function is not waiting for the database operation
> Promise chain is not handling errors properly
> Race condition in concurrent operations
```

### Database Debugging

#### ORM Issues

```bash
# Prisma/Sequelize problems
> ORM query is generating inefficient SQL
> Relationship loading is causing N+1 query problem
> Migration is failing with constraint errors
```

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Step-by-Step Analysis

```bash
# Trace execution flow
> Walk through this function step by step and identify where it fails
> Trace the data flow from API call to component rendering
> Analyze the user interaction flow that causes this bug
```

### Root Cause Analysis

```bash
# Deep investigation
> What are all the possible causes of this intermittent error?
> Investigate why this bug only happens in production
> Analyze the differences between working and broken environments
```

### Debugging Tools Integration

```bash
# Browser DevTools
> Help me interpret this console error stack trace
> Analyze these network requests in the DevTools
> Debug this React component using the React DevTools

# Node.js debugging
> Set up debugging configuration for VS Code
> Add console.log statements for debugging this issue
> Use Node.js inspector for step-by-step debugging
```

## Error Prevention

### Defensive Programming

```bash
# Add safeguards
> Add input validation to prevent invalid data
> Implement proper error boundaries in React
> Create fail-safe mechanisms for critical operations
```

### Testing for Edge Cases

```bash
# Comprehensive testing
> Write tests that cover error scenarios
> Test with edge case data inputs
> Simulate network failures and timeouts
```

## Debugging Workflows

### Systematic Problem Solving

1. **Reproduce** the issue consistently
2. **Isolate** the problem to specific code areas
3. **Analyze** the code and data flow
4. **Hypothesize** potential causes
5. **Test** solutions incrementally
6. **Verify** the fix works completely

### Example Debugging Session

```bash
# Step 1: Report the problem
> Users can't login - getting "Invalid credentials" error even with correct passwords

# Step 2: Gather information
> Show me the login form submission code
> Check the authentication API endpoint
> Review the password verification logic

# Step 3: Analyze findings
> The password hashing is using different salt rounds than expected
> Add debugging logs to trace the authentication flow

# Step 4: Implement fix
> Update the password comparison to use the correct hash format
> Add proper error logging for authentication failures

# Step 5: Test thoroughly
> Test login with various user accounts
> Verify error messages are appropriate
> Check that security isn't compromised
```

## Common Debugging Patterns

### Error Boundaries and Fallbacks

```bash
# React error handling
> Add error boundaries to catch component errors
> Create fallback UI for when components fail
> Implement graceful degradation for API failures
```

### Logging and Monitoring

```bash
# Observability
> Add structured logging throughout the application
> Implement error tracking with proper context
> Set up monitoring alerts for critical errors
```

### Environment Differences

```bash
# Development vs Production
> Debug why this works in development but fails in production
> Compare environment variables and configuration
> Check for missing dependencies or different versions
```

## When to Ask for Help

### Complex Issues

```bash
# Multi-layered problems
> This issue involves React state, API calls, and database queries
> Help me understand the interaction between these systems
> Break down this complex bug into smaller, manageable parts
```

### Performance Debugging

```bash
# Optimization challenges
> Profile this application to identify performance bottlenecks
> Analyze why this page loads slowly
> Optimize the critical rendering path
```

### Security Issues

```bash
# Security vulnerabilities
> Check this code for potential security vulnerabilities
> Audit the authentication system for security flaws
> Implement proper input sanitization and validation
```

## Tips for Effective Debugging with AI

### Provide Context

- Include error messages and stack traces
- Describe what you expected vs. what happened
- Mention recent changes that might be related
- Share relevant code snippets

### Be Specific

- Ask for specific debugging steps
- Request targeted code analysis
- Specify the type of solution you need

### Iterate and Learn

- Test suggested solutions incrementally
- Ask for explanations of the root causes
- Request prevention strategies for similar issues

### Follow Up

- Report back on solution effectiveness
- Ask for alternative approaches if needed
- Request additional safeguards or improvements

Remember, debugging is often an iterative process. Don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions and request clarifications as you work through the problem.
