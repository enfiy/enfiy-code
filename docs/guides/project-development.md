> Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
> Configure monitoring and alerting for production

# Infrastructure as code
> Create Terraform configuration for AWS deployment
> Set up Kubernetes manifests for container orchestration
> Design a scalable architecture for high traffic
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Communication with AI

```bash
# Be specific about requirements
> Create a responsive navbar with logo, navigation links, and user dropdown that works on mobile devices

# Provide context
> Looking at the existing authentication system, add password reset functionality

# Ask for explanations
> Explain why you chose this approach for state management
> What are the trade-offs of this architecture decision?
```

### Iterative Development

```bash
# Start simple and iterate
1. > Create a basic user registration form
2. > Add client-side validation to the registration form
3. > Implement server-side validation and error handling
4. > Add email verification to the registration process
5. > Style the form to match the design system
```

### Code Organization

```bash
# Maintain clean architecture
> Organize these utility functions into logical modules
> Refactor this component to separate concerns better
> Create a consistent file naming convention for the project
```
