## Quickstart

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js version 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.
2. **Run the CLI:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npx @enfiy/enfiy-code
   ```

   Or install it globally with:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @enfiy/enfiy-code
   enfiy
   ```

3. **First-time setup:** When you run Enfiy Code for the first time, you'll be guided through:
   - Picking a color theme
   - Selecting an AI provider (local or cloud)
   - Configuring authentication for your chosen provider

4. **Smart configuration:** Once configured, Enfiy Code will remember your settings and automatically use your last selected model on subsequent runs.

You are now ready to use Enfiy Code!
