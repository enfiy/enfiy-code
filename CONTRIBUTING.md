Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Contribution Process

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.

### Pull Request Guidelines

To help us review and merge your PRs quickly, please follow these guidelines. PRs that do not meet these standards may be closed.

#### 1. Link to an Existing Issue

All PRs should be linked to an existing issue in our tracker. This ensures that every change has been discussed and is aligned with the project's goals before any code is written.

- **For bug fixes:** The PR should be linked to the bug report issue.
- **For features:** The PR should be linked to the feature request or proposal issue that has been approved by a maintainer.

If an issue for your change doesn't exist, please **open one first** and wait for feedback before you start coding.

#### 2. Keep It Small and Focused

We favor small, atomic PRs that address a single issue or add a single, self-contained feature.

- **Do:** Create a PR that fixes one specific bug or adds one specific feature.
- **Don't:** Bundle multiple unrelated changes (e.g., a bug fix, a new feature, and a refactor) into a single PR.

Large changes should be broken down into a series of smaller, logical PRs that can be reviewed and merged independently.

#### 3. Use Draft PRs for Work in Progress

If you'd like to get early feedback on your work, please use GitHub's **Draft Pull Request** feature. This signals to the maintainers that the PR is not yet ready for a formal review but is open for discussion and initial feedback.

#### 4. Ensure All Checks Pass

Before submitting your PR, ensure that all automated checks are passing by running `npm run preflight`. This command runs all tests, linting, and other style checks.

#### 5. Update Documentation

If your PR introduces a user-facing change (e.g., a new command, a modified flag, or a change in behavior), you must also update the relevant documentation in the `/docs` directory.

#### 6. Write Clear Commit Messages and a Good PR Description

Your PR should have a clear, descriptive title and a detailed description of the changes. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for your commit messages.

- **Good PR Title:** `feat(cli): Add --json flag to 'config get' command`
- **Bad PR Title:** `Made some changes`

In the PR description, explain the "why" behind your changes and link to the relevant issue (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## Forking

If you are forking the repository you will be able to run the Built, Test and Integration test workflows. However in order to make the integration tests run you'll need to add a [GitHub Repository Secret](<[url](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)>) with a value of `GEMINI_API_KEY` and set that to a valid API key that you have available. Your key and secret are private to your repo; no one without access can see your key and you cannot see any secrets related to this repo.

Additionally you will need to click on the `Actions` tab and enable workflows for your repository, you'll find it's the large blue button in the center of the screen.

## Development Setup and Workflow

This section guides contributors on how to build, modify, and understand the development setup of this project.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**

1. Install [Node 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Git

### Build Process

To clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enfiy-ecosystem/enfiy-cli.git # Or your fork's URL
cd enfiy-cli
```

To install dependencies defined in `package.json` as well as root dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To build the entire project (all packages):

```bash
npm run build
```

This command typically compiles TypeScript to JavaScript, bundles assets, and prepares the packages for execution. Refer to `scripts/build.js` and `package.json` scripts for more details on what happens during the build.

### Enabling Sandboxing

Container-based [sandboxing](#sandboxing) is highly recommended and requires, at a minimum, setting `ENFIY_SANDBOX=true` in your `~/.env` and ensuring a container engine (e.g. `docker` or `podman`) is available. See [Sandboxing](#sandboxing) for details.

To build both the `enfiy` CLI utility and the sandbox container, run `build:all` from the root directory:

```bash
npm run build:all
```

To skip building the sandbox container, you can use `npm run build` instead.

### Running

To start the Enfiy Code from the source code (after building), run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
npm start
```

If you’d like to run the source build outside of the enfiy-cli folder you can utilize `npm link path/to/enfiy-cli/packages/cli` (see: [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-link)) or `alias enfiy="node path/to/enfiy-cli/packages/cli"` to run with `enfiy`

### Running Tests

This project contains two types of tests: unit tests and integration tests.

#### Unit Tests

To execute the unit test suite for the project:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run tests located in the `packages/core` and `packages/cli` directories. Ensure tests pass before submitting any changes. For a more comprehensive check, it is recommended to run `npm run preflight`.

#### Integration Tests

The integration tests are designed to validate the end-to-end functionality of the Enfiy Code. They are not run as part of the default `npm run test` command.

To run the integration tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

For more detailed information on the integration testing framework, please see the [Integration Tests documentation](./docs/integration-tests.md).

### Linting and Preflight Checks

To ensure code quality and formatting consistency, run the preflight check:

```bash
npm run preflight
```

This command will run ESLint, Prettier, all tests, and other checks as defined in the project's `package.json`.

_ProTip_

after cloning create a git precommit hook file to ensure your commits are always clean.

```bash
echo "
# Run npm build and check for errors
if ! npm run preflight; then
  echo "npm build failed. Commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi
" > .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

#### Formatting

To separately format the code in this project by running the following command from the root directory:

```bash
npm run format
```

This command uses Prettier to format the code according to the project's style guidelines.

#### Linting

To separately lint the code in this project, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Coding Conventions

- Please adhere to the coding style, patterns, and conventions used throughout the existing codebase.
- **Imports:** Pay special attention to import paths. The project uses `eslint-rules/no-relative-cross-package-imports.js` to enforce restrictions on relative imports between packages.

#### Building and running

Before submitting any changes, it is crucial to validate them by running the full preflight check. This command will build the repository, run all tests, check for type errors, and lint the code.

To run the full suite of checks, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run preflight
```

This single command ensures that your changes meet all the quality gates of the project. While you can run the individual steps (`build`, `test`, `typecheck`, `lint`) separately, it is highly recommended to use `npm run preflight` to ensure a comprehensive validation.

#### Writing Tests

This project uses **Vitest** as its primary testing framework. When writing tests, aim to follow existing patterns. Key conventions include:

##### Test Structure and Framework

- **Framework**: All tests are written using Vitest (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`).
- **File Location**: Test files (`*.test.ts` for logic, `*.test.tsx` for React components) are co-located with the source files they test.
- **Configuration**: Test environments are defined in `vitest.config.ts` files.
- **Setup/Teardown**: Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach`. Commonly, `vi.resetAllMocks()` is called in `beforeEach` and `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`.

##### Mocking (`vi` from Vitest)

- **ES Modules**: Mock with `vi.mock('module-name', async (importOriginal) => { ... })`. Use `importOriginal` for selective mocking.
  - _Example_: `vi.mock('os', async (importOriginal) => { const actual = await importOriginal(); return { ...actual, homedir: vi.fn() }; });`
- **Mocking Order**: For critical dependencies (e.g., `os`, `fs`) that affect module-level constants, place `vi.mock` at the _very top_ of the test file, before other imports.
- **Hoisting**: Use `const myMock = vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn());` if a mock function needs to be defined before its use in a `vi.mock` factory.
- **Mock Functions**: Create with `vi.fn()`. Define behavior with `mockImplementation()`, `mockResolvedValue()`, or `mockRejectedValue()`.
- **Spying**: Use `vi.spyOn(object, 'methodName')`. Restore spies with `mockRestore()` in `afterEach`.

##### Commonly Mocked Modules

- **Node.js built-ins**: `fs`, `fs/promises`, `os` (especially `os.homedir()`), `path`, `child_process` (`execSync`, `spawn`).
- **External SDKs**: `@google/genai`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **Internal Project Modules**: Dependencies from other project packages are often mocked.

##### React Component Testing (CLI UI - Ink)

- Use `render()` from `ink-testing-library`.
- Assert output with `lastFrame()`.
- Wrap components in necessary `Context.Provider`s.
- Mock custom React hooks and complex child components using `vi.mock()`.

##### Asynchronous Testing

- Use `async/await`.
- For timers, use `vi.useFakeTimers()`, `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()`, `vi.runAllTimersAsync()`.
- Test promise rejections with `await expect(promise).rejects.toThrow(...)`.

##### General Guidance

- When adding tests, first examine existing tests to understand and conform to established conventions.
- Pay close attention to the mocks at the top of existing test files; they reveal critical dependencies and how they are managed in a test environment.

#### Git Repo

The main branch for this project is called "main"

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

When contributing to this React, Node, and TypeScript codebase, please prioritize the use of plain JavaScript objects with accompanying TypeScript interface or type declarations over JavaScript class syntax. This approach offers significant advantages, especially concerning interoperability with React and overall code maintainability.

##### Preferring Plain Objects over Classes

JavaScript classes, by their nature, are designed to encapsulate internal state and behavior. While this can be useful in some object-oriented paradigms, it often introduces unnecessary complexity and friction when working with React's component-based architecture. Here's why plain objects are preferred:

- Seamless React Integration: React components thrive on explicit props and state management. Classes' tendency to store internal state directly within instances can make prop and state propagation harder to reason about and maintain. Plain objects, on the other hand, are inherently immutable (when used thoughtfully) and can be easily passed as props, simplifying data flow and reducing unexpected side effects.

- Reduced Boilerplate and Increased Conciseness: Classes often promote the use of constructors, this binding, getters, setters, and other boilerplate that can unnecessarily bloat code. TypeScript interface and type declarations provide powerful static type checking without the runtime overhead or verbosity of class definitions. This allows for more succinct and readable code, aligning with JavaScript's strengths in functional programming.

- Enhanced Readability and Predictability: Plain objects, especially when their structure is clearly defined by TypeScript interfaces, are often easier to read and understand. Their properties are directly accessible, and there's no hidden internal state or complex inheritance chains to navigate. This predictability leads to fewer bugs and a more maintainable codebase.

- Simplified Immutability: While not strictly enforced, plain objects encourage an immutable approach to data. When you need to modify an object, you typically create a new one with the desired changes, rather than mutating the original. This pattern aligns perfectly with React's reconciliation process and helps prevent subtle bugs related to shared mutable state.

- Better Serialization and Deserialization: Plain JavaScript objects are naturally easy to serialize to JSON and deserialize back, which is a common requirement in web development (e.g., for API communication or local storage). Classes, with their methods and prototypes, can complicate this process.

##### Embracing ES Module Syntax for Encapsulation

Rather than relying on Java-esque private or public class members, which can be verbose and sometimes limit flexibility, we strongly prefer leveraging ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) for encapsulating private and public APIs.

- Clearer Public API Definition: With ES modules, anything that is exported is part of the public API of that module, while anything not exported is inherently private to that module. This provides a very clear and explicit way to define what parts of your code are meant to be consumed by other modules.

- Enhanced Testability (Without Exposing Internals): By default, unexported functions or variables are not accessible from outside the module. This encourages you to test the public API of your modules, rather than their internal implementation details. If you find yourself needing to spy on or stub an unexported function for testing purposes, it's often a "code smell" indicating that the function might be a good candidate for extraction into its own separate, testable module with a well-defined public API. This promotes a more robust and maintainable testing strategy.

- Reduced Coupling: Explicitly defined module boundaries through import/export help reduce coupling between different parts of your codebase. This makes it easier to refactor, debug, and understand individual components in isolation.

##### Avoiding `any` Types and Type Assertions; Preferring `unknown`

TypeScript's power lies in its ability to provide static type checking, catching potential errors before your code runs. To fully leverage this, it's crucial to avoid the `any` type and be judicious with type assertions.

- **The Dangers of `any`**: Using any effectively opts out of TypeScript's type checking for that particular variable or expression. While it might seem convenient in the short term, it introduces significant risks:
  - **Loss of Type Safety**: You lose all the benefits of type checking, making it easy to introduce runtime errors that TypeScript would otherwise have caught.
  - **Reduced Readability and Maintainability**: Code with `any` types is harder to understand and maintain, as the expected type of data is no longer explicitly defined.
  - **Masking Underlying Issues**: Often, the need for any indicates a deeper problem in the design of your code or the way you're interacting with external libraries. It's a sign that you might need to refine your types or refactor your code.

- **Preferring `unknown` over `any`**: When you absolutely cannot determine the type of a value at compile time, and you're tempted to reach for any, consider using unknown instead. unknown is a type-safe counterpart to any. While a variable of type unknown can hold any value, you must perform type narrowing (e.g., using typeof or instanceof checks, or a type assertion) before you can perform any operations on it. This forces you to handle the unknown type explicitly, preventing accidental runtime errors.

  ```
  function processValue(value: unknown) {
     if (typeof value === 'string') {
        // value is now safely a string
        console.log(value.toUpperCase());
     } else if (typeof value === 'number') {
        // value is now safely a number
        console.log(value * 2);
     }
     // Without narrowing, you cannot access properties or methods on 'value'
     // console.log(value.someProperty); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.
  }
  ```

- **Type Assertions (`as Type`) - Use with Caution**: Type assertions tell the TypeScript compiler, "Trust me, I know what I'm doing; this is definitely of this type." While there are legitimate use cases (e.g., when dealing with external libraries that don't have perfect type definitions, or when you have more information than the compiler), they should be used sparingly and with extreme caution.
  - **Bypassing Type Checking**: Like `any`, type assertions bypass TypeScript's safety checks. If your assertion is incorrect, you introduce a runtime error that TypeScript would not have warned you about.
  - **Code Smell in Testing**: A common scenario where `any` or type assertions might be tempting is when trying to test "private" implementation details (e.g., spying on or stubbing an unexported function within a module). This is a strong indication of a "code smell" in your testing strategy and potentially your code structure. Instead of trying to force access to private internals, consider whether those internal details should be refactored into a separate module with a well-defined public API. This makes them inherently testable without compromising encapsulation.

##### Embracing JavaScript's Array Operators

To further enhance code cleanliness and promote safe functional programming practices, leverage JavaScript's rich set of array operators as much as possible. Methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.slice()`, `.sort()`, and others are incredibly powerful for transforming and manipulating data collections in an immutable and declarative way.

Using these operators:

- Promotes Immutability: Most array operators return new arrays, leaving the original array untouched. This functional approach helps prevent unintended side effects and makes your code more predictable.
- Improves Readability: Chaining array operators often leads to more concise and expressive code than traditional for loops or imperative logic. The intent of the operation is clear at a glance.
- Facilitates Functional Programming: These operators are cornerstones of functional programming, encouraging the creation of pure functions that take inputs and produce outputs without causing side effects. This paradigm is highly beneficial for writing robust and testable code that pairs well with React.

By consistently applying these principles, we can maintain a codebase that is not only efficient and performant but also a joy to work with, both now and in the future.

#### React (mirrored and adjusted from [react-mcp-server](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4448b18760d867f9e009e810571e7a3b8930bb19/compiler/packages/react-mcp-server/src/index.ts#L376C1-L441C94))

##### Role

You are a React assistant that helps users write more efficient and optimizable React code. You specialize in identifying patterns that enable React Compiler to automatically apply optimizations, reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving application performance.

##### Follow these guidelines in all code you produce and suggest

Use functional components with Hooks: Do not generate class components or use old lifecycle methods. Manage state with useState or useReducer, and side effects with useEffect (or related Hooks). Always prefer functions and Hooks for any new component logic.

Keep components pure and side-effect-free during rendering: Do not produce code that performs side effects (like subscriptions, network requests, or modifying external variables) directly inside the component's function body. Such actions should be wrapped in useEffect or performed in event handlers. Ensure your render logic is a pure function of props and state.

Respect one-way data flow: Pass data down through props and avoid any global mutations. If two components need to share data, lift that state up to a common parent or use React Context, rather than trying to sync local state or use external variables.

Never mutate state directly: Always generate code that updates state immutably. For example, use spread syntax or other methods to create new objects/arrays when updating state. Do not use assignments like state.someValue = ... or array mutations like array.push() on state variables. Use the state setter (setState from useState, etc.) to update state.

Accurately use useEffect and other effect Hooks: whenever you think you could useEffect, think and reason harder to avoid it. useEffect is primarily only used for synchronization, for example synchronizing React with some external state. IMPORTANT - Don't setState (the 2nd value returned by useState) within a useEffect as that will degrade performance. When writing effects, include all necessary dependencies in the dependency array. Do not suppress ESLint rules or omit dependencies that the effect's code uses. Structure the effect callbacks to handle changing values properly (e.g., update subscriptions on prop changes, clean up on unmount or dependency change). If a piece of logic should only run in response to a user action (like a form submission or button click), put that logic in an event handler, not in a useEffect. Where possible, useEffects should return a cleanup function.

Follow the Rules of Hooks: Ensure that any Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, custom Hooks, etc.) are called unconditionally at the top level of React function components or other Hooks. Do not generate code that calls Hooks inside loops, conditional statements, or nested helper functions. Do not call Hooks in non-component functions or outside the React component rendering context.

Use refs only when necessary: Avoid using useRef unless the task genuinely requires it (such as focusing a control, managing an animation, or integrating with a non-React library). Do not use refs to store application state that should be reactive. If you do use refs, never write to or read from ref.current during the rendering of a component (except for initial setup like lazy initialization). Any ref usage should not affect the rendered output directly.

Prefer composition and small components: Break down UI into small, reusable components rather than writing large monolithic components. The code you generate should promote clarity and reusability by composing components together. Similarly, abstract repetitive logic into custom Hooks when appropriate to avoid duplicating code.

Optimize for concurrency: Assume React may render your components multiple times for scheduling purposes (especially in development with Strict Mode). Write code that remains correct even if the component function runs more than once. For instance, avoid side effects in the component body and use functional state updates (e.g., setCount(c => c + 1)) when updating state based on previous state to prevent race conditions. Always include cleanup functions in effects that subscribe to external resources. Don't write useEffects for "do this when this changes" side-effects. This ensures your generated code will work with React's concurrent rendering features without issues.

Optimize to reduce network waterfalls - Use parallel data fetching wherever possible (e.g., start multiple requests at once rather than one after another). Leverage Suspense for data loading and keep requests co-located with the component that needs the data. In a server-centric approach, fetch related data together in a single request on the server side (using Server Components, for example) to reduce round trips. Also, consider using caching layers or global fetch management to avoid repeating identical requests.

Rely on React Compiler - useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo can be omitted if React Compiler is enabled. Avoid premature optimization with manual memoization. Instead, focus on writing clear, simple components with direct data flow and side-effect-free render functions. Let the React Compiler handle tree-shaking, inlining, and other performance enhancements to keep your code base simpler and more maintainable.

Design for a good user experience - Provide clear, minimal, and non-blocking UI states. When data is loading, show lightweight placeholders (e.g., skeleton screens) rather than intrusive spinners everywhere. Handle errors gracefully with a dedicated error boundary or a friendly inline message. Where possible, render partial data as it becomes available rather than making the user wait for everything. Suspense allows you to declare the loading states in your component tree in a natural way, preventing “flash” states and improving perceived performance.

##### Process

1. Analyze the user's code for optimization opportunities:
   - Check for React anti-patterns that prevent compiler optimization
   - Look for component structure issues that limit compiler effectiveness
   - Think about each suggestion you are making and consult React docs for best practices

2. Provide actionable guidance:
   - Explain specific code changes with clear reasoning
   - Show before/after examples when suggesting changes
   - Only suggest changes that meaningfully improve optimization potential

##### Optimization Guidelines

- State updates should be structured to enable granular updates
- Side effects should be isolated and dependencies clearly defined

#### Comments policy

Only write high-value comments if at all. Avoid talking to the user through comments.

### Project Structure

- `packages/`: Contains the individual sub-packages of the project.
  - `cli/`: The command-line interface.
  - `server/`: The backend server that the CLI interacts with.
- `docs/`: Contains all project documentation.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for building, testing, and development tasks.

For more detailed architecture, see `docs/architecture.md`.

## Debugging

### VS Code:

0.  Run the CLI to interactively debug in VS Code with `F5`
1.  Start the CLI in debug mode from the root directory:
    ```bash
    npm run debug
    ```
    This command runs `node --inspect-brk dist/enfiy.js` within the `packages/cli` directory, pausing execution until a debugger attaches. You can then open `chrome://inspect` in your Chrome browser to connect to the debugger.
2.  In VS Code, use the "Attach" launch configuration (found in `.vscode/launch.json`).

Alternatively, you can use the "Launch Program" configuration in VS Code if you prefer to launch the currently open file directly, but 'F5' is generally recommended.

To hit a breakpoint inside the sandbox container run:

```bash
DEBUG=1 enfiy
```

### React DevTools

To debug the CLI's React-based UI, you can use React DevTools. Ink, the library used for the CLI's interface, is compatible with React DevTools version 4.x.

1.  **Start the Enfiy Code in development mode:**

    ```bash
    DEV=true npm start
    ```

2.  **Install and run React DevTools version 4.28.5 (or the latest compatible 4.x version):**

    You can either install it globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g react-devtools@4.28.5
    react-devtools
    ```

    Or run it directly using npx:

    ```bash
    npx react-devtools@4.28.5
    ```

    Your running CLI application should then connect to React DevTools.
    ![](/docs/assets/connected_devtools.png)

## Sandboxing

### MacOS Seatbelt

On MacOS, `enfiy` uses Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) under a `permissive-open` profile (see `packages/cli/src/utils/sandbox-macos-permissive-open.sb`) that restricts writes to the project folder but otherwise allows all other operations and outbound network traffic ("open") by default. You can switch to a `restrictive-closed` profile (see `.../sandbox-macos-strict.sb`) that declines all operations and outbound network traffic ("closed") by default by setting `SEATBELT_PROFILE=restrictive-closed` in your environment or `.env` file. Available built-in profiles are `{permissive,restrictive}-{open,closed,proxied}` (see below for proxied networking). You can also switch to a custom profile `SEATBELT_PROFILE=<profile>` if you also create a file `.enfiy/sandbox-macos-<profile>.sb` under your project settings directory `.enfiy`.

### Container-based Sandboxing (All Platforms)

For stronger container-based sandboxing on MacOS or other platforms, you can set `ENFIY_SANDBOX=true|docker|podman|<command>` in your environment or `.env` file. The specified command (or if `true` then either `docker` or `podman`) must be installed on the host machine. Once enabled, `npm run build:all` will build a minimal container ("sandbox") image and `npm start` will launch inside a fresh instance of that container. The first build can take 20-30s (mostly due to downloading of the base image) but after that both build and start overhead should be minimal. Default builds (`npm run build`) will not rebuild the sandbox.

Container-based sandboxing mounts the project directory (and system temp directory) with read-write access and is started/stopped/removed automatically as you start/stop Enfiy Code. Files created within the sandbox should be automatically mapped to your user/group on host machine. You can easily specify additional mounts, ports, or environment variables by setting `SANDBOX_{MOUNTS,PORTS,ENV}` as needed. You can also fully customize the sandbox for your projects by creating the files `.enfiy/sandbox.Dockerfile` and/or `.enfiy/sandbox.bashrc` under your project settings directory (`.enfiy`) and running `enfiy` with `BUILD_SANDBOX=1` to trigger building of your custom sandbox.

#### Proxied Networking

All sandboxing methods, including MacOS Seatbelt using `*-proxied` profiles, support restricting outbound network traffic through a custom proxy server that can be specified as `ENFIY_SANDBOX_PROXY_COMMAND=<command>`, where `<command>` must start a proxy server that listens on `:::8877` for relevant requests. See `scripts/example-proxy.js` for a minimal proxy that only allows `HTTPS` connections to `example.com:443` (e.g. `curl https://example.com`) and declines all other requests. The proxy is started and stopped automatically alongside the sandbox.

## Manual Publish

We publish an artifact for each commit to our internal registry. But if you need to manually cut a local build, then run the following commands:

```
npm run clean
npm install
npm run auth
npm run prerelease:dev
npm publish --workspaces
```
